A Haar Cascade is basically a classifier which is used to detect the object for which it has been trained for, from the source.

The Haar Cascade is trained by superimposing the positive image over a set of negative images. The training is generally done on a server and on various stages. Better results are obtained by using high quality images and increasing the amount of stages for which the classifier is trained.
